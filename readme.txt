A simple quiz tool aimed at individuals wanting to insert formative questions into their wordpress posts and pages.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does this do summative assessment?**

Yes the quiz can record answers if a quiz is deployed. If you deploy an individual question feedback is given but responses are not saved. This can be very useful for formative assessment.

**What options are there for quizzes?**

Currently you pick 'x' questions at random from a question pot. These questions are displayed randomly. No timers are available.

More options will be available in future releases

**What question types does this support?**

Currently you can do single reponse and multiple response questions. You can also write 'reflective' questions where you ask users to think of an answer before getting them to click a button which displays an 'ideal answer'.

More question types will be written in future updates.
 

**How do I use this tool?**

To display a question.

1. Create a question pot (questions must be stored in a question pot)

2. Create your questions within the pot.

3. Each question has its own shortcode which can be pasted into a post or page OR you can use the 'in editor' button to select a specific question if you are unsure how to use shortcodes.

 

**To deploy a quiz.**

1.  Create a new quiz and choose to display 'x' questions at random from pot 1 and (for example) 'x' questions at random from pot 2.
2.  Copy the quiz shortcode onto a page.

The quiz option currently only saves the HIGHEST score and quizzes can be taken as often as possible. It will only save the score if a user is logged in.

A results screen shows the highest score achieved by each registered user.

**Can anonymous users take a quiz**

Yes, but results won't be stored in the database

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
