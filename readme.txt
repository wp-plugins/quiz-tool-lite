A simple quiz tool aimed at individuals wanting to insert formative questions into their wordpress posts and pages.

== Description ==
This tool was originally written as we wanted to disply an individual question on a page, along with feedback for formative assessment.
It also has the following features 123

== Installation ==


1. Upload the 'quiz-tool-lite' folder  to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
1. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this do summative assessment? =

Yes the quiz can record answers if a quiz is deployed. If you deploy an individual question feedback is given but responses are not saved. This can be very useful for formative assessment.

= What options are there for quizzes? =

Currently you pick 'x' questions at random from a question pot. These questions are displayed randomly. No timers are available. Currently feedback is given by default and this cannot be switched off.
More options will be available in future releases

= What question types does this support? =

Currently you can do single reponse and multiple response questions. You can also write 'reflective' questions where you ask users to think of an answer before getting them to click a button which displays an 'ideal answer'.
More question types will be written in future updates.

= How do I use this tool? =
To display a question:
1. Create a question pot
2. Create questions within the pot
3. Each question has its own shortcode which can be pasted into a post or page OR you can use the 'in editor' button to select a specific question if you are unsure how to use shortcodes.

To deploy a quiz
1. Create your question pots and questions
2. Create a new quiz and choose to display 'x' questions at random from pot 1 and (for example) 'x' questions at random from pot 2.
3. Copy the quiz shortcode onto a page

The quiz optino currently only saves the HIGHEST score and quizzes can be taken as often as possible. It will only save the score if a user is logged in.
A results screen shows the highest score achieved by each user.

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets 
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png` 
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
